## How to Add Your Screenshots

You've shared screenshots of your application. To add them to the README:

### Step 1: Save Your Screenshots

Save your screenshot images to this `screenshots/` folder with these exact filenames:

1. **upload-interface.png** - Light mode upload page
2. **dark-mode.png** - Dark mode view  
3. **csv-preview.png** - CSV data preview after successful upload
4. **upload-history.png** - Upload history dashboard
5. **error-view.png** - Error message display

### Step 2: File Naming

Make sure the filenames match exactly (case-sensitive):
- ✅ `upload-interface.png`
- ✅ `dark-mode.png`
- ✅ `csv-preview.png`
- ✅ `upload-history.png`
- ✅ `error-view.png`

### Step 3: Image Format

- **Format:** PNG or JPG
- **Recommended size:** 1920x1080 for desktop screenshots
- **Quality:** High quality (not compressed)

### Step 4: Verify

After adding the files, check that:
- All files are in the `screenshots/` folder
- Filenames match exactly
- Images display correctly in the README

## Quick Reference

Based on your shared screenshots, you have:

1. ✅ Upload Interface (Light Mode) - Main upload page with drag & drop
2. ✅ Dark Mode View - Dark theme with purple gradients
3. ✅ CSV Preview - Successful import with data table

## Troubleshooting

If images don't show in README:
